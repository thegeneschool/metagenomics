The tutorial makes heavy use of a pig metagenomic timeseries and Hi-C dataset that was generated by Daniela Gaio and Kay Anantanawat. Several people have made key contributions to the overarching project in which the pig metagenomic data was generated, including Toni Chapman (NSW DPI), Steven P. Djordjevic (UTS), Michael YZ Liu, Tiziana Zingali, Linda Falconer, Joyce To, and Leigh Monahan.
