	abstract = {Most microbes cannot be easily cultured, and metagenomics provides a means to study them. Current techniques aim to resolve individual genomes from metagenomes, so-called metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Leading approaches depend upon time series or transect studies, the efficacy of which is a function of community complexity, target abundance, and sequencing depth. We describe an unsupervised method that exploits the hierarchical nature of Hi-C interaction rates to resolve MAGs using a single time point. We validate the method and directly compare against a recently announced proprietary service, ProxiMeta. bin3C is an open-source pipeline and makes use of the Infomap clustering algorithm (https://github.com/cerebis/bin3C).},

MEGAHIT assembles the data as a whole, i.e. no pre-processing like partitioning and normalization was needed. When compared with previous methods on assembling the soil data, MEGAHIT generated a three-time larger assembly, with longer contig N50 and average contig length; furthermore, 55.8\% of the reads were aligned to the assembly, giving a fourfold improvement.},

	abstract = {We previously reported on MetaBAT, an automated metagenome binning software tool to reconstruct single genomes from microbial communities for subsequent analyses of uncultivated microbial species. MetaBAT has become one of the most popular binning tools largely due to its computational efficiency and ease of use, especially in binning experiments with a large number of samples and a large assembly. MetaBAT requires users to choose parameters to fine-tune its sensitivity and specificity. If those parameters are not chosen properly, binning accuracy can suffer, especially on assemblies of poor quality. Here, we developed MetaBAT 2 to overcome this problem. MetaBAT 2 uses a new adaptive binning algorithm to eliminate manual parameter tuning. We also performed extensive software engineering optimization to increase both computational and memory efficiency. Comparing MetaBAT 2 to alternative software tools on over 100 real world metagenome assemblies shows superior accuracy and computing speed. Binning a typical metagenome assembly takes only a few minutes on a single commodity workstation. We therefore recommend the community adopts MetaBAT 2 for their metagenome binning experiments. MetaBAT 2 is open source software and available at https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/metabat.},

	abstract = {Advances in high-throughput sequencing and ‘omics technologies are revolutionizing studies of naturally occurring microbial communities. Comprehensive investigations of microbial lifestyles require the ability to interactively organize and visualize genetic information and to incorporate subtle differences that enable greater resolution of complex data. Here we introduce anvi’o, an advanced analysis and visualization platform that offers automated and human-guided characterization of microbial genomes in metagenomic assemblies, with interactive interfaces that can link ‘omics data from multiple sources into a single, intuitive display. Its extensible visualization approach distills multiple dimensions of information about each contig, offering a dynamic and unified work environment for data exploration, manipulation, and reporting. Using anvi’o, we re-analyzed publicly available datasets and explored temporal genomic changes within naturally occurring microbial populations through de novo characterization of single nucleotide variations, and linked cultivar and single-cell genomes with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. Anvi’o is an open-source platform that empowers researchers without extensive bioinformatics skills to perform and communicate in-depth analyses on large ‘omics datasets.},
